1- The update system scan a .txt file via URL. (ex : anthonymontreuil.me/version.txt) with ONE line (the version).

2- c# split the text, and compare with the application version.

3- if the version.txt version is more recent than the application version, he will propose to download the new updates.

If user click on OK, the application will open his favorite webbrowser with this link:

http://www.github.com/mykerbal/SoftInc-Modder/releases/version/download/SoftInc-modder-version.zip

version = version.txt version.

(example : if you see "4.4.4.0" in the textfiles, it means :

http://www.github.com/mykerbal/SoftInc-Modder/releases/4.4.4.0/download/SoftInc-modder-4.4.4.0.zip

So, you MUST :

1- create a website from a github repository (it's free, but this a link like www.mykerbal.github.com but it doesn't matter)

2- create a "version.txt" with only ONE line (the version, always x.x.x.x)

3- create a release on your SoftInc-Modder repository (pre-release if the first number of version is 0), and upload a .zip of your software (.zip called "SoftInc-modder-version" where version si the update version like 0.4.4.0)

4- That's all !
